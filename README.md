# GAB workshop: Biodiversity & Spatial Analysis

This workshop will introduce concepts and methods for mapping spatial patterns of biological diversity. It will consider the meaning, measurement and use of diversity metrics such as phylogenetic diversity and endemism. Through
prepared examples, participants will learn how to link spatial and phylogenetic data for a group of species to both visualise and measure the spatial component of evolution, for example to identify areas with distinct or unique biota.

The software **[Biodiverse](http://shawnlaffan.github.io/biodiverse/ "Biodiverse Homepage")** will be used for this workshop. Participants are assumed to be comfortable interpreting phylogenetic trees but do not need prior experience with spatial information.

For those who want to do the exercises in this workshop, please install *Biodiverse* in advance.
